**Today's Progress**

Ok let's try this again

The Project I'm working on is my Portfolio/Blog site I'm making with React and Contentful. I Created the content models for the post types I want to have on my blog. Using Contentful I brought them into the state of my react app. Then sorted them into different sections with map. Tomorrow I need to create components for the different sections and pass the data the created components through props.

**Thoughts**

I'm starting to see why it helps to build projects instead of just following endless tutorials. Although, I am kind of following a tutorial on how to use React and Contentful together. Mine is different enough where I feel like I'm learning a great deal.

**TOTAL TIME: Unknown**
