### Day 1: June 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Ok let's try this again

The Project I'm working on is my Portfolio/Blog site I'm making with React and Contentful. I Created the content models for the post types I want to have on my blog. Using Contentful I brought them into the state of my react app. Then sorted them into different sections with map. Tomorrow I need to create components for the different sections and pass the data the created components through props.

**Thoughts**

I'm starting to see why it helps to build projects instead of just following endless tutorials. Although, I am kind of following a tutorial on how to use React and Contentful together. Mine is different enough where I feel like I'm learning a great deal.

**TOTAL TIME: Unknown**

## Day 2: June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Switched from using just react to using gatsby which is this super cool static site generator that uses react. I'll work on it a little more after I log this. Hopefully finish loading in the projects and the 100 days of code logs

**Thoughts**

I pretty much got to the same spot I was at yesterday but I feel like I'm learning more and more about react but I'm still following tutorials fairly close.

**TOTAL TIME: didn't keep track**

## Day 3: June 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Only had about an hour to work on my portfolio so I didn't get much done. So I sectioned off my graphql calls in gatsby-node.js, created a LinkTo.js component to link to different blog posts or log posts or project posts. Then sectioned off those into different lists. I still need to make graphql calls for the project pages of my of my portfolio and then think about adding a featured tag to my contentful content things.

**Thoughts**

I'm glad I made some progress in spite of the short amount of time I got to work on my porject

**TOTAL TIME: didn't keep track**
